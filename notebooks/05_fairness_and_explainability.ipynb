ethical evaluation of the recommendation system by:\n","- Assessing fairness considerations in recommender systems\n","- Discussing potential sources of bias in the MovieLens dataset\n","- Interpreting model behavior and recommendation outputs\n","- Reflecting on responsible and explainable AI practices\n","\n","This notebook aligns with:\n","- Capstone Step: Ethical AI, Fairness, and Explainability"],"metadata":{"id":"VdBVvxtDh4Vz"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Why Fairness in Recommendation Systems Matters\n","\n","Recommendation systems influence what users watch, buy, or consume.  \n","Biases in these systems can:\n","- Over-represent popular items while marginalizing niche preferences\n","- Reinforce historical or demographic biases in the data\n","- Create feedback loops that limit diversity and fairness\n","\n","Therefore, evaluating fairness and explainability is a critical part of responsible AI development.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"FJJ9mmSah9hV"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Potential Sources of Bias in MovieLens 1M\n","\n","The MovieLens 1M dataset is widely used for academic research, but it is not free from bias.\n","\n","Potential bias sources include:\n","- **Popularity bias**: Popular movies receive more ratings and dominate recommendations\n","- **User activity bias**: Highly active users influence model learning more than casual users\n","- **Temporal bias**: Older movies have accumulated more interactions over time\n","- **Demographic bias**: User demographics are limited and not fully representative of the population\n","\n","These factors can affect both model performance and fairness outcomes.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"EL5y3El5iGDX"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Fairness Perspective Applied\n","\n","In this project, fairness is assessed qualitatively using:\n","- Exposure fairness: Are recommendations overly concentrated on a narrow set of items?\n","- User fairness: Does the system produce reasonable recommendations across users?\n","- Outcome plausibility: Do recommendations align with general user expectations?\n","\n","While no protected attributes are explicitly modeled, fairness is discussed through system behavior and outcomes.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"VzIYaIVviLSl"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Explainability of Matrix Factorization Models\n","\n","Matrix Factorization models (such as TruncatedSVD) are not fully transparent, but they offer partial interpretability:\n","\n","- Latent factors represent hidden dimensions of user preferences and item characteristics\n","- Recommendations emerge from similarity in latent space\n","- Although factors are abstract, the resulting recommendations can be evaluated for coherence\n","\n","This level of explainability is sufficient for offline analysis and ethical inspection in this project context.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"bFA89vm_iPk6"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Linking Explainability to Qualitative Evaluation\n","\n","In Notebook 04, Top-10 recommendations were generated for sample users.\n","\n","The recommended movies included:\n","- Critically acclaimed films\n","- Popular and well-rated titles\n","- Genre-consistent selections\n","\n","This qualitative check complements RMSE-based evaluation by confirming that the ranked outputs are interpretable and plausible for real users.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"DTGXiFQMiVJc"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Limitations of the Current Approach\n","\n","Despite positive results, several limitations remain:\n","\n","- No explicit fairness metrics (e.g., demographic parity) are computed\n","- Latent factors are not directly interpretable\n","- The model does not incorporate user-aware fairness constraints\n","- Offline evaluation cannot fully capture real-world impact\n","\n","These limitations highlight opportunities for future improvement.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"fQhks8dFiXut"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Responsible AI Considerations\n","\n","This project follows responsible AI principles by:\n","- Avoiding sensitive personal attributes in modeling\n","- Transparently reporting limitations\n","- Complementing quantitative metrics with qualitative analysis\n","- Emphasizing interpretability and ethical reflection\n","\n","Such practices are essential when deploying recommendation systems in real-world settings.\n"],"metadata":{"id":"CWl9bTUJibxH"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Conclusion\n","\n","This notebook completes the capstone by addressing fairness and explainability considerations.\n","\n","Key takeaways:\n","- The recommendation system improves upon baseline performance\n","- Generated recommendations are coherent and plausible\n","- Ethical reflection strengthens trust in model outcomes\n","- Fairness and explainability are integral to responsible ML practice\n","\n","Together, the notebooks demonstrate an end-to-end, ethically aware recommendation
